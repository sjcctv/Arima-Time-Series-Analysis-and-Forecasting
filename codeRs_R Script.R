###########  2.   Model decomposition

### 2.2. stl- decomposes the time series data as seasonal,trend and remainder ,follows additive model

#stl : stl( ) performs a seasonal decomposition of a given time series Xt by determining the trend Tt using "loess" regression 
#and then calculating the seasonal component St (and the residuals et) from the differences Xt-Tt

stl_air <- stl(x, s.window=5)
stl_air

#shows the additive decomposition of the data - as components are independent of each other

# 2.2.2 Seasonal pattern

#monthplot - plot seasonal (or other) subseries of a time series. 
#For each season (or other category), a time series is plotted.
monthplot(stl_air$time.series[,"seasonal"]/1000000, main="AIRLINE - Number of passengers in millions By Month",

#can be used for building non0-seasonal model if seasonal variation is not our prime interest

# displays the original data in gray

## 2.3. Classific Decomposition

# follows moving average apprach to decompose time series components

# Downsides-not robust,assumptions

# Overcome classic decomposition - stl used
